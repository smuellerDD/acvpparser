/**
 * @brief Symmetric cipher data structure holding the data for the cipher
 *	  operations specified in sym_backend
 *
 * @var key [in] Symmetric key for cipher operation in binary form
 * @var key2 [disregard] Please disregard this buffer
 * @var key3 [disregard] Please disregard this buffer
 * @var iv [in] IV for the cipher operation in binary form. It may be empty
 *		  for ciphers that do not support IVs (like AES-ECB or AES-KW).
 *		  Note, for XTS, this buffer contains the tweak value.
 * @var cipher [in] Cipher specification as defined in cipher_definitions.h
 * @var data [in/out] Buffer with input data that is also expected to hold
 *			the result data. Note, if the buffer size needs to be
 *			different for the output data than for the input
 *			data, the backend must change the buffer as needed.
 *			The buffer is freed by the parser.
 * @var data_len_bits [in] Length of input data in bits. This value is
 *			     used for CFB-1 where only some bits out of a byte
 *			     is relevant for testing.
 * @var xts_sequence_no [in] If XTS sequence number is requested, it is
 *			       stored in this variable. In this case, the IV
 *			       is NULL.
 * @var xts_data_unit_len [in] Length of XTS data unit in bits.
 * @var inner_loop_final_cj1[out] This value is optional and contains the final
 * 				  C[j-1] cipher text from the inner loop for
 *				  AES. If this value is set the inner loop of
 *				  the MCT testing implemented in the parser is
 *				  skipped and only the outer loop is performed.
 *				  If the backend does not implement the inner
 *				  loop (which is assumed to be the default),
 *				  this buffer should not be touched by the
 *				  backend.
 * @var integrity_error [out] This variable is to be filled by the backend
 *			      during a decryption operation to indicate
 *			      whether the decryption was successful (0 value)
 *			      or whether an integrity error occurred (value
 *			      of 1). Note, in this case, the @var data
 *			      buffer should be released.
 * @var kwcipher [in] KW type - Inverse or Cipher
 * @var priv [storage] This pointer allows the backend to store private data
 *			 like a pointer to a cipher handle allocated during
 *			 the init call and used during update or fini calls.
 *			 The backend must deallocate the resources during fini
 *			 call.

/**
 * @brief Callback data structure that must be implemented by the backend. Some
 *	  callbacks only need to be implemented if the respective cipher support
 *	  shall be tested.
 *
 * All functions return 0 on success or != 0 on error. Note, if an
 * authenticating cipher returns an integrity error during decryption, the data
 * buffer with the return data must contain the value of
 * CIPHER_DECRYPTION_FAILED with CIPHER_DECRYPTION_FAILED_LEN buffer size. Yet
 * the return code MUST be 0 as test vectors deliberately provide data with
 * integrity errors.
 *
 * @var encrypt Callback implementing the encrypt operation using the
 *		  @var data buffer. The @var parsed_flags point to flags
 *		  specified in parser_flags.h.
 * @var decrypt Callback implementing the decrypt operation using the
 *		  @var data buffer. The @var parsed_flags point to flags
 *		  specified in parser_flags.h.

 * MCT testing implies that a cipher handle with its state is
 * initialized and then kept alive for successive cipher operations.
 * I.e. if a block chaining mode other than ECB is used, the state
 * of the block chaining mode must be retained.
 * Each cipher operation must perform the requested
 * encryption/decryption operation on the current cipher handle state
 * and return the ciphertext/plaintext.
 *
 * @var mct_init Initialize the cipher handle. The @var parsed_flags contain
 *		   either FLAG_OP_ENC or FLAG_OP_DEC for encryption/decryption.
 *		   The allocated cipher handle may be stored in the priv
 *		   pointer.
 * @var mct_update Perform a crypto operation on the cipher handle and
 *		     return the result of the crypto operation.
 * @var mct_fini Free all resources pertaining the cipher operation.
