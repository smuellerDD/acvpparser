/**
 * @brief KECCAK Message Authentication Code (KMAC) cipher data structure holding
 *	  the data for the cipher operations specified in kmac_backend
 *
 * @var key [in] Symmetric key for cipher operation in binary form.
 * @var msg [in] Data buffer holding the message to be hashed in binary form.
 * @var maclen [in] Length of the requested message digest in bits - depending
 *		    on the cipher requests, the message digest length may
 *		    deviate from the digest size.
 * @val keylen [in] The length of key
 * @var mac [out] Message digest of the message in binary form.
 *		    Note, the backend must allocate the buffer of the right
 *		    size before storing data in it. The parser frees the memory.
 * @val customization [in] optional customization bit string of any length.
 *			   Note, the parser already converts the test data
 *			   into the right format. I.e. if the test vector
 *			   defines a hexadecimal buffer, the parser converts
 *			   it automatically into binary. If it is a string
 *			   the customization string is found in the buffer.
 *			   The IUT simply has to consume the provided buffer
 *			   without performing any conversion operation.
 * @var verify_result [out] This variable is to be filled by the backend
 *			    during a Verification test whether verification was
 *			    successful or not.
 * @val xof_enabled [in] eXtendable-Output filled to enable XOF mode or not
 * @var cipher [in] Cipher specification as defined in cipher_definitions.
 *
 * @var hex_customization [internal] Ignore
